	I go to the gym a lot, and I have always been wary of devices other than my phone and laptop that can connect to the internet. 
	In most cases, it simply seems unnecessary, while in others, the privacy or security implications could be more serious. 
	Treadmills fall into the second category because of their potential to cause physical harm to a user if they malfunction in 
	some way. After consistently finding treadmills with internet connection capabilities in hotel gyms, the gym at work, and the 
	gym area of my favorite rock climbing place, I decided to research how secure these machines actually were and whether there was 
	any risk to the physical safety of their users. This project was part of my internship with IBM's X-Force Red in 2023, and was 
	a joint effort with Anthony Ioppolo and Josh Merrill. 
	<br>
	<br>
	We began by learning as much as possible about how the consoles worked on various brands of treadmills. These consoles allow you 
	to view your workout stats, choose a workout program, watch Netflix and Hulu, play Spotify, and even sometimes have a web browser. 
	We also used open-source intelligence (OSINT) to discover information that manufacturers may have publicly available, whether they 
	intend to or not. Based on this initial research, we decided to focus on two brands of treadmills, Precor and Matrix. 
	<br>
	<h2>
	Matrix
	</h2>
        Matrix has a wide range of smart gym equipment and many different consoles. To begin our search for vulnerabilities, we had to acquire 
	a copy of the software runnng on those consoles. Without having physical access to one of these treadmills, we looked to see if we 
	could download it online. Customers may need to be able to do this if the software on their machine gets corrupted or if an update is released. 
	Typically, smart treadmills are updated over the internet, but in some cases, users may want to have a treadmill with a screen without actually 
	connecting it to the internet. For these customers, another method of updating has to be available. Users can download a zipped file containing 
	the updated console software to a USB and plug it in to the treadmill. A key stored on the system will unlock the zip file and update the system.
	<br>
	<br>
	We downloaded the update file for several versions of the Matrix consoles. These updates were in a password protected zip file. 
	All attempts to unencrypt this zip file were unsuccessful, since we did not have access to the password that would be stored on the 
	treadmills, and it was not vulnerable to a brute force attack. No useful information could be obtained from the zip file, so we thought 
	we were out of luck. However, our OSINT had uncovered another path forward.
	<br>
	<br>
	While looking for sources that may give an indication of the password to the zip file, we came across an open Amazon S3 bucket. 
	An investigation of the contents of this bucket revealed that it was used to serve the zipped update files, but by going up a directory, 
	the unzipped files for each of their consoles were also available! We downloaded these files for offline analysis. 
	<br>
	<br>
	In the end, although we were able obtain the unencrypted files, we did not uncover any vulnerabilities in the console software. 
	The public availability of these files were reported to the vendor, and CVE-2023-49219 and CVE-2023-49220 were assigned for this 
	information disclosure.
	<h2>
	Precor
	</h2>
	We didn't have particularly interesting findings from Matrix, so we moved on to Precor treadmills. This seemed promising as we discovered 
	a number of manuals through OSINT that revealed administrator codes and passwords we could use. Precor also allows their treadmills to 
	be updated offline via USB. Customers can download the latest version of the console software from the Precor software updates site, which is 
	protected by a username and password. However, a username and password are not particularly useful at preventing access to the page when 
	the necessary credentials are published in a publicly available manual for how to perform these USB updates. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Equipped with these credentials, we logged into the software page and downloaded a copy of the console software for each of the models, the 
	P80, P62, and P82. As we started investigating the software, it was clear that each of the consoles used a Linux-based filesystem. We began 
	looking through the most important Linux files to see if there was anything interesting, such as checking for users' home directories, 
	looking at the /etc/passwd file, and seeing whether any firewall rules were in place. 
	<br>
	<br>
	The P62 and P82 consoles were essentially identical, and the P80, which is an older model, had some differences. The /etc/passwd file in 
	the P80 software led to our first real finding of the project. On modern Linux systems, users' password hashes are stored in the /etc/shadow 
	file, which is only readable by the root user. However, on this machine, the root password hash was stored in the globally readable /etc/passwd 
	file. We were able to crack this password hash and obtain the password for the root account in plaintext! This vulnerability was assigned to 
	CVE-2023-49223.
	<br>
	<br>
	Since we already had access to the entire filesystem through the downloaded software, this password did not really unlock any new doors for us. 
	We decided to move on to exploring the firewall rules for the consoles. The firewall rules showed three open services: SSH, Android Debug Bridge 
	(ADB), and Precor Remote Debug. As the Precor Remote Debug path seemed like it would be a proprietary form of connection, we chose to focus on 
	SSH access instead, and this turned out to be our best decision of the project. 
	<br>
	<br>
	We had the root password from the P80 console, so we wondered if we were able to use this to log in via SSH. Many systems are configured to 
	disallow root login through SSH with a password and we were unsure whether these would be like that, so we also wanted to find out which 
	other users may be available. The first thing to check was the contents of the SSH authorized_keys file. If the consoles shipped with a public 
	key that allowed login to anyone with the associated private key, this would leave a path to connect to any of the thousands of Precor treadmills 
	worldwide. First, we checked the authorized_keys file on the P82 software. It contained one public key! Next we looked at P62. This, too, 
	had one public key in the authorized_keys file, and it was the same one as the P82. Finally, we checked whether this key was present on the P80, 
	and it was! One private key, presumably held by someone at Precor, would allow SSH login into every Precor smart treadmill. We were unbelievably 
	excited by this finding, since if that private key was ever leaked, it would compromise many machines. 
	<br>
	<br>
	The P82 and P62 had no other files in the SSH directory, so we expected the hardcoded public key to be our biggest finding. There was the 
	thought in the back of our minds though, "What if we could find that private key?" A further investigation of the P80 software revealed 
	what appeared to be a set of keys in the SSH directory: an id_rsa.pub and id_rsa file. This seemed too good to be true, so we checked the 
	contents of the id_rsa.pub and found that it was identical to the public key in the authorized_keys file on all three console versions! 
	This looked like it was actually a set of valid keys for all Precor treadmills! Now, testing it was our top priority. As we did not have 
	access to a treadmill with one of these consoles, we copied the key files from the console software to our own computer, 
	uploaded the public key to a virtual machine and attempted to use the private key to SSH into it. Immediately, we were connected, and 
	we knew we had to now find a way to test this in the real world. 
	<br>
	<h2>
	Testing
	</h2>
	Finding a treadmill seems like an easy task, but getting permission to perform security tests on it is more difficult than finding the 
	vulnerabilities in the first place. The gym on our office campus had Precor treadmills with P62 consoles, so we figured this would be the 
	ideal solution. However, despite explaining our research and what we planned to do, sending many emails, and having a face-to-face meeting 
	with the gym owners, we were not granted permission to test the SSH keys at this gym. This led to an investigation into every gym in Austin 
	to see which ones had the right brand of treadmills with the smart consoles. Eventually, we found that one of the climbing gyms had what we 
	were looking for. They had no problem with us performing tests as long as we promised that everything we were doing would not affect the 
	safety of their treadmills, so we got right to work.
	<br>
	<br>
	We needed to be on the same network as the treadmills in order to test SSH, so the first thing we had to do was find out what network 
	they were using. The network setup on Precor treadmills is within the admin panel, which does require a password, but this password is 
	also available online through their manuals and we were able to get into this menu. This gym did not have their machines connected to 
	a network, so we connected the treadmill to a hotspot that was also used for our laptops. After the treadmill was connected and had an IP address, 
	we attempted to SSH to the root user at that IP using the private key we found. Some adjustments to file permissions and permitted algorithms 
	were needed on our end, but after it was properly configured, it connected and we had our first root shell on a real treadmill!
	<br>
	<br>
	We poked around in the file system on the live machine, but it resembled the software update we had downloaded and did not provide any new 
	insights. We were especially interested in having the ability to change the speed of the treadmill remotely, either directly or by uploading 
	a workout program that users could select, but since speed and incline adjustments were made through phyiscal buttons on the console, this 
	was not something we were able to accomplish during the course of the project. Another outcome that could pose a risk to users is being able 
	to stop the treadmill belt unexpectedly over SSH. We didn't find a function to do this on its own, however, by issuing a reboot command to 
	the console, the entire treadmill reboots. The console turns off, disconnecting our SSH session, but not before the belt is brought to an 
	uneven stop. At a slow pace, this is not particularly dangerous, but at higher speeds, the belt jerks and slows unpredictably, which could 
	cause a user to fall.
	<br>
	<br>
	This easy attack demonstrated that we could obtain root user privileges and potentially cause harm to users just by bringing a device with the 
	identified SSH private key with us to a gym. These vulnerabilities were reported to Precor and issued CVEs CVE-2023-49221, CVE-2023-49222, and 
	CVE-2023-49224.
	<br>
	<h2>
	Conclusion
	</h2>
	Although this was the extent of our testing due to time limitations of this research, it would be possible for an attacker to expand the impact 
	under certain conditions. Consider a corporate gym that has internet-connected treadmills attached to their network. Someone could walk into this 
	gym, connect their device to the same network as a low priveleged user, and begin a port scan of the network. This port scan would reveal the 
	treadmills as Linux devices that have port 22 open, and potentially the ADB and Precor Remote Debug ports open. Without ever having to touch 
	the console of the treadmill, the attacker now knows the IP address of the treadmill and can use the SSH key to connect and have root-level access 
	to a device on the network, giving them significantly more capabilities. 
	<br>
	<br>
	In another scenario, an attacker can get on the treadmill with their phone, looking like a normal user. After starting a walk, they can access the 
	service menu, find the IP address of the treadmill, and SSH to that address using their phone. They can then get off the treadmill, wait for another 
	user to start running, and stop the machine. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Although we were very excited to find these vulnerabilities, what is fun for us as security researchers is not fun for the vendors or owners of 
	these machines. As a result, we ensured that we went through a proper vulnerability disclosure process to notify the vendor and allow them to 
	issue patches for the software before publicly disclosing our findings. The goal of this project was to bring awareness to the security of smart 
	gym equipment and make these devices safer for users.
