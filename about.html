	 <h2>Intro</h2>
      Hi, I am Kyri Lea, a 5th year BS/MS Computing Security student at Rochester Institute of Technology. 
      I enjoy participating in Red vs Blue and Pentesting competitions, like ISTS and CPTC. My primary interests
      are Active Directory penetration testing, data privacy, and all things Linux. 
      <br>
      <br>
      I have six summers of experience working in the cybersecurity field. I spent four summers at Digi-Key Electronics
      working with the security team on data privacy, application security, logging and monitoring systems, and identity
      and access management. Most recently, I interned on IBM's X-Force Red and researched security vulnerabilities 
      associated with smart gym equipment. I am currently working for X-Force Red as a co-op penetration tester.
      <br>

      <h2>Involvement</h2>
      I am a member of RITSEC - the cybersecurity club at RIT, the Linux Users Group (RITlug), and the RIT Gymnastics Club.
      I held the position of treasurer for RITlug for the 2022-2024 school years and was the secretary for Gymnastics Club 
      2022-2024. In my free time, I like to go bouldering, do gymnastics, and go shopping.
