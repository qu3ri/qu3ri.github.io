	 <h2>Intro</h2>
      Hi, I am Kyri Lea. I recently graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology with a BS/MS degree in Cybersecurity.
      I love mainframes and z/OS, and I have been working on creating more open-source tooling for mainframe pentesting 
      as part of my most recent internship and co-op with IBM X-Force Red. I also enjoy data privacy and all things Linux. 
      Throughout college I participated in a number of Red vs. Blue, pentesting, and CTF competitions, something I hope to 
      continue to be involved with in the future. 
      <br>

      I have six summers of experience working in the cybersecurity field. I spent four summers at Digi-Key Electronics
      working with the security team on data privacy, application security, logging and monitoring systems, and identity
      and access management. For the past two summers, I interned on IBM's X-Force Red where I researched security vulnerabilities 
      associated with smart gym equipment and developed M-Ray, a z/OS pentesting tool.

      <h2>Outside Cybersecurity</h2>
      I like to stay active in my free time. Earlier this year I competed in my first 10k race and I am trying to stay motivated 
      by signing up for more races in the future. I am involved with gymnastics, bouldering, and volleyball, and I spend a lot 
      of time in the gym.

      Shopping is one of my favorite passtimes. My style inspiration comes from the character Villanelle on the show Killing Eve, 
      and I have the goal of collecting all of her outfits. So far I have about 26 of them and I am always working on finding the 
      perfect pieces to expand the collection.
