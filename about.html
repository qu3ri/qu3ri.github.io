      Hi, I am Kyri Lea, a 4th year BS/MS Computing Security student at Rochester Institute of Technology. 
      I enjoy participating in Red vs Blue and Pentesting competitions, like ISTS and CPTC. My primary interests
      are Active Directory penetration testing, data privacy, and all things Linux. 
      <br>
      <br>
      In my free time, I like to go bouldering, do gymnastics, go shopping. I am the secretary for RIT's Gymnastics Club
      and the treasurer for the Linux Users Group (RITlug). As part of RITlug, I have given presentations on 
      <a href="https://ritlug.com/talks/2022/09/09/w3-basic-commands/"><u>Intro to the Linux Command Line</u></a>, 
      <a href="https://ritlug.com/talks/2023/03/31/w11-intro-to-pam/"><u>Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)</u></a>, 
      <a href="https://ritlug.com/talks/2023/12/01/pentesting/"><u>Pentesting Linux Systems</u></a>, and 
      <a href="https://ritlug.com/talks/2024/03/08/mainframes/"><u>Mainframes</u></a>.

      I have five summers of experience working in the cybersecurity field. I spent four summers at Digi-Key Electronics
      working with the security team on data privacy, application security, logging and monitoring systems, and identity
      and access management. Most recently, I interned on IBM's X-Force Red and researched security vulnerabilities 
      associated with smart gym equipment. I am currently working for X-Force Red as a co-op penetration tester.
